# GIF Converter
 The Graphics Interchange Format (GIF; /ɡɪf/ GHIF or /dʒɪf/ JIF) is a bitmap image format that was developed by a team at the online services provider CompuServe led by American computer scientist Steve Wilhite on 15 June 1987.[1] It has since come into widespread usage on the World Wide Web due to its wide support and portability between applications and operating systems.
